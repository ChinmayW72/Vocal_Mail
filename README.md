# Voice-Based Gmail Management System

This project allows users to interact with Gmail using voice commands and a Flask web application. The system provides features such as reading and composing emails, checking inbox, and interacting with the email system hands-free through speech recognition.

## Features
- **Voice Interaction:** Use voice commands to check emails, read them aloud, or compose new emails.
- **Gmail Integration:** Read and send emails using the Gmail API with OAuth2 authentication.
- **Flask Web Application:** A simple Flask app that serves a dashboard and allows users to interact with their Gmail account.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Responses and email contents are read aloud using `pyttsx3`.
- **Speech Recognition:** Captures voice commands using `speech_recognition` and `sounddevice`.
